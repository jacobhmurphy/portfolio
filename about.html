        <hr class="hrAbout">
        <p>I am a web developer based in Orlando, Florida. I possess strong written and oral communication abilities in addition to technical skills that include math, CSS and HTML, JavaScript, and Excel. I am currently working on this site, and an unnamed project. Previous projects I've worked on are on my Projects page. If you would like to contact me, please see my Contact page.</p>

        <p>My hobbies include weightlifting, video games, and running. I am also an avid sports fan; I'll watch almost anything though my real love is the Florida Gators.</p>
